### Welcome!  
The team at Gadgetry.io is a group of skilled practitioners focused on advanced business
capabilities delivered through open source technology and cloud based services. Our team
of experienced practitioners have broad backgrounds working with organizations
that range in size from lean startups to large Fortune 500 companies. We
are a caffeinated and hoppy blend of software and infrastructure engineering talent.

<br>
Our team initially met and worked together over the course of several years for
an international startup based in Nashville, Chicago, and London. During our time
working together we enjoyed the challenge and freedom of using open source technology
to deliver platform as a service (PaaS) for a big data analytics and targeting engine used
by financial institutions and advertisers in the payment card industry.

<br>
Our passion is sharing our knowledge and expertise to implement ingenious open source
and cloud based solutions so that teams of all sizes can realize the benefits from
a well-engineered platform.  In addition to our consulting services here you will also
find our thoughts, ideas, rants, and inner daemons.  

<br>
Cheers!
<br>-Brian
